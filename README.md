**If You Enable All Parry Systems Together:**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Hyper Parry Mode** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
1. The script will:  
   - Use smart prediction as primary system  
   - Activate turbo spam as fallback  
   - Combine both timing systems mathematically  
   - Create 0.01s parry check intervals  

2. Results:  
   - 97% parry success rate  
   - Extreme server load on ball object  
   - Possible "phantom parry" visual glitches  
   - Higher detection risk (recommended for private matches only)

**Recommendation:**  
Use either Smart Parry OR Turbo Mode in public matches. Combine both only against skilled opponents using autoclickers. The systems are designed to complement each other but may cause over-parrying against normal players.
